# Contributing to Ollama Middleware

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Ollama Middleware as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to sync code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/planichttm/ollama-middleware/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/planichttm/ollama-middleware/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/planichttm/ollama-middleware.git
   cd ollama-middleware
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash

   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Coding Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (we use Prettier and ESLint)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use descriptive variable and function names

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments to new public APIs
- Update the CHANGELOG.md for notable changes
- Include examples in documentation
